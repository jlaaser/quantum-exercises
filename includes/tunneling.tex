\section*{Tunneling\sectionmark{Tunneling}}

	Consider a particle incident ``from the left'' on the following potential barrier, with the particle's energy less than the barrier height, e.g. $E<V_0$:

					\begin{equation}
				 		V(x)=\begin{cases}0 & x<0 \\ V_0 & 0 \leq x \leq L \\ 0 & x>L \end{cases} \nonumber

	\begin{questions}
	
		\question What are the general solutions for the wavefunction in each region? Make sure to include any appropriate coefficients.

		\question What are the boundary conditions necessary for...
		
			\begin{parts}
				\part ... the \emph{wavefunction} to be continuous at $x=0$ and $x=L$?
				
					%\emph{(Note: you don't need to plug anything into the wavefunctions; it's sufficient to write your answers in the form of $\Psi_I(x_0) = \Psi_{II}(x_0)$, etc.)}
				
					\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\end{solution}
				
				\part ... the \emph{first derivative} of the wavefunction  to be continuous at $x=0$ and $x=L$?
				
					\begin{solution}[1.3in]
					\end{solution}
				
				\contdnewpg 
				
				\part ... the particle to be incident only from the left?
				
					\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\end{solution}
				
				%\part ... ``arbitrary'' normalization?
				
				%	\begin{solution}[1.5in]
				%	\end{solution}
			\end{parts}
		
		\question What ratio would you calculate if you wanted to find the probability that the particle is transmitted through the barrier (e.g. the tunneling probability)?
				
					\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\end{solution}
		
		\question If you do all the algebra, you will find that the tunneling probability for a tall, thin barrier is approximately
			\begin{equation*}
				T = \frac{16E(V_0-E)}{V_0^2} e^{-2\sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0-E)}{\hbar^2}}L}
			\end{equation*}
			
			What do you predict would happen to to the tunneling probability if...
			\begin{parts}
				\part ... you increased the particle's mass?
				
					\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\end{solution}
				
				\part ... you decreased the barrier width?
				
					\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\end{solution}
			\end{parts}
