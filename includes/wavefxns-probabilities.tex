	If $\ket{\Psi} = \sum_i c_i \ket{i}$, where the $\{\ket{i}\}$ are the eigenstates of operator $\hat\Omega$, then
	\begin{align*}
		\braket{\Psi|\hat\Omega|\Psi} &= \left(\sum_i c_i^* \bra{i}\right) \hat\Omega \left(\sum_j c_j \ket{j}\right)\\
			&= \sum_i |c_i|^2 \omega_i
	\end{align*}
	(You will prove this on your first homework set.)
	
	\begin{questions}
	
		\question This has a similar form to a weighted average, e.g.
			\begin{equation*}
				\left\langle \omega \right\rangle = \sum_i P_i \omega_i
			\end{equation*}
			where $P_i$ is the probability of measuring value $\omega_i$. 
			In this context, how would you interpret $|c_i|^2$?
			
			\begin{solution}[1in]
			\end{solution}
			
		\question Remember that you can find $c_i$ by calculating $\braket{i|\Psi}$. Given this, how would you interpret the value of $\left|\braket{i|\Psi}\right|^2$?
			
			\begin{solution}[1in]
			\end{solution}
		
		\question A particularly useful set of eigenstates are the eigenstates of the position operator, $\hat x$, where eigenstate $\ket{x_1}$ corresponds to the eigenstate in which we measure the position of the particle as being exactly at $x=x_1$ and nowhere else.
		
			In this context, how would you interpret the value of $|\braket{x_1|\Psi}|^2$?
			
			\begin{solution}[1.75in]
			\end{solution}

		\newpage
		\question More generally, how would you interpret the function $|\Psi(x)|^2$ where $\Psi(x) = \braket{x|\Psi}$?
		
			\begin{solution}[2in]
			\end{solution}
			
		\question What should have to be true about the value of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx\, |\Psi(x)|^2$?
		
			\emph{Hint: what should the total probability of finding the particle \emph{somewhere} along the x axis be?}
		
			\begin{solution}
			\end{solution}
		
	\end{questions}
